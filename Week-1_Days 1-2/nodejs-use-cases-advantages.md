# Node.js: Use Cases and Advantages

## Common Use Cases

1. Web Applications
   - [Full-stack JavaScript development (MEAN/MERN stack)](https://github.com/longvv/NodeJS-begin-to-advance-in-2-weeks/blob/main/Week-1_Days%201-2/mean-mern-stack-nodejs.md)
   - Single-page applications (SPAs)
   - Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

2. Real-time Applications
   - Chat applications
   - Collaborative tools (e.g., document editing)
   - Gaming servers
   - Live streaming

3. API Development
   - RESTful APIs
   - Microservices architecture
   - Backend for mobile applications

4. DevOps and Build Tools
   - Task runners (e.g., Grunt, Gulp)
   - Bundlers (e.g., Webpack)
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

5. Internet of Things (IoT)
